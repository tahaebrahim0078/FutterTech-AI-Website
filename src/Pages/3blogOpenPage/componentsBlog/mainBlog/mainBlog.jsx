              <p>
                One of the most prominent applications of AI in healthcare is in
                diagnostic imaging. AI algorithms have demonstrated remarkable
                proficiency in interpreting medical images such as X-rays, MRIs,
                and CT scans. They can identify anomalies and deviations that
                might be overlooked by the human eye. This is particularly
                valuable in early disease detection. For instance, AI can aid
                radiologists in detecting minute irregularities in mammograms or
                identifying critical findings in chest X-rays, potentially
                indicative of life-threatening conditions.
